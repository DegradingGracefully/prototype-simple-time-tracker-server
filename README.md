This is just a temporary repo that I had to publish in order to share some code ;)

It contains __the server project__ of a working simple time tracker prototype programmed in Node, Express, Svelte and MongoDB.

And even though I plan to open source this app eventually, it currently doesn't have enough features (plus source code needs some refactoring and cleaning).

So, in a word, don't try to use it :p

Thanks Wisdom Ekpot which code @ https://codesource.io/build-a-blog-app-with-expressjs-and-sveltejs/ I used to boostrap this project.
